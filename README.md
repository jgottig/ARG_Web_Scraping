# ARG_Web_Scraping

Web Scraping for supermarket prices in Argentina (Rosario)

Web Scraping with Python --> Selenium and beautifulsoup4
Data ETL with Python --> Pandas
Data Analyst with Python --> Pandas and Power BI

You only need to modify the Input and Output paths of the Script_x.py and Datacleaning.py files.
And need to modify the Google Profile if is necessary
Data Cleaning is used for another SaaS created with Streamlit, in case you prefer not to use Power Bi, the downloads would be ready.


I also include a dashboard created in Power Bi to test the analyzed data.
